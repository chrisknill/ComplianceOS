    incidents/route.ts      â†’ GET, POST Incident
    investigations/route.ts â†’ GET, POST Investigation
    actions/route.ts        â†’ GET, POST Action

## ðŸ“Š ISO 45001 Clause Mapping

Add to `lib/iso.ts`:

```typescript
export const ISO_45001_CLAUSES: Record<string, string> = {
  '4': 'Context of the Organization',
  '5': 'Leadership and Worker Participation',
  '5.1': 'Leadership and Commitment',
  '5.2': 'OH&S Policy',
  '5.3': 'Organizational Roles',
  '5.4': 'Consultation and Participation',
  '6': 'Planning',
  '6.1': 'Actions to Address Risks and Opportunities',
  '6.1.1': 'General',
  '6.1.2': 'Hazard Identification',
  '6.1.2.1': 'Hazard Identification Process',
  '6.1.3': 'Determining Legal and Other Requirements',
  '6.2': 'OH&S Objectives and Planning',
  '7': 'Support',
  '7.2': 'Competence',

  '7.4': 'Communication',
  '7.5': 'Documented Information',
  '8': 'Operation',
  '8.1': 'Operational Planning and Control',

  '10': 'Improvement',
  '10.1': 'General',
  '10.2': 'Incident, Nonconformity and Corrective Action',
  '10.3': 'Continual Improvement',
}
```

## ðŸŽ¯ KPI Calculations

Add to `lib/ohs.ts`:

```typescript
export function calculateTRIR(recordableIncidents: number, totalHours: number): number {
  return (recordableIncidents * 200000) / totalHours
}

export function calculateLTIFR(lostTimeInjuries: number, totalHours: number): number {
  return (lostTimeInjuries * 1000000) / totalHours
}

export function calculateDART(daysAwayRestrictedTransferred: number, totalHours: number): number {
  return (daysAwayRestrictedTransferred * 200000) / totalHours
}

export function getNearMissRatio(nearMisses: number, incidents: number): number {
  return incidents > 0 ? nearMisses / incidents : 0
}
```

## ðŸŒ± Seed Data Template

Add to `prisma/seed.ts`:

### OH&S Hazards

- Manual handling injuries
- Equipment hazards
- Chemical exposures
- Noise exposure
- Confined space entry

- Medical treatment (7%)
- Lost time (2%)
- Serious injuries (1%)

### Actions (CAPA)
- Corrective actions from incidents
- Preventive actions from audits
- Improvement actions from objectives

### Permits
- Hot work permits
- Confined space entry
- Work at height
- LOTO procedures

### Contractors
- 5-10 contractors with varying safety ratings
- Mix of pre-qualified and pending
- Recent evaluations

### Audits
- Quarterly workplace inspections
- Annual OH&S audits
- Monthly behavioral safety observations

### Competence Records
- PPE requirements by role
- Training matrices
- Medical fitness tracking

### Health Surveillance
- Noise exposure monitoring

## ðŸ”’ Permissions & Roles

Extend existing user roles:

- **OH&S Manager**: Full access to all OH&S modules
- **Supervisor**: View hazards, report incidents, issue permits
- **Worker**: Report hazards, submit near-misses, view own training
- **Contractor**: Limited access, view own permits

## ðŸ“± Mobile Considerations

- Incident reporting via mobile
- Permit approvals
- Hazard photo uploads
- QR code permit verification

## ðŸ”„ Integration Points

1. **Training Matrix**: Link to OH&S competence
2. **Risk Register**: Reference OH&S hazards
3. **Document Control**: Link OH&S procedures
4. **Audit Module**: Combine QMS/EMS/OH&S audits

## ðŸ“ˆ Reporting Requirements

### Monthly Reports
- Incident summary
- TRIR/LTIFR trends
- Action close-out rates
- Permit statistics

### Quarterly Reports
- Objective progress
- Audit findings summary
- Contractor performance
- Health surveillance compliance

### Annual Reports
- Management review input
- Year-over-year comparisons
- Certification audit prep
- Strategic planning

## âœ… Acceptance Criteria

1. All 11 OH&S pages functional
2. CRUD operations for all entities
3. KPI calculations accurate
4. Seed data realistic
5. ISO 45001 clause mapping complete
6. RAG status indicators consistent
7. Mobile-responsive design
8. API authentication enforced
9. Documentation updated
10. Zero TypeScript errors

## ðŸš€ DEPLOYMENT READY

Once pages are created following existing patterns:

1. Run migration: `npx prisma migrate dev --name add_iso_45001`
2. Seed OH&S data: `npx prisma db seed`
3. Test all routes
4. Deploy to Azure (same process as before)

**Estimated Monthly Cost Impact**: No change (~$20-30/month)
- SQLite handles additional tables efficiently
- No additional infrastructure needed

---

**Status**: Schema & Navigation Complete âœ“
**Next**: Create pages following existing patterns
**Timeline**: 2-4 hours to complete all pages
**Complexity**: Low (template-based implementation)
