- Sequential numbering per case type per year

#### **Auto-Assigned Due Dates**
Based on severity:
- **CRITICAL**: 5 days
- **HIGH**: 10 days

#### **Auto-Created Actions**
When `containmentNeeded` is true for NC cases:
- Automatically creates a CONTAINMENT action
- Due in 24 hours
- HIGH priority
- Linked to global actions system
